## 🧠 "I think, therefore I am... searchable" - Descartes, probably

PeeKaboo isn't just a search engine; it's a philosophical journey into the heart of digital darkness. As you dive deeper, remember: the abyss also gazes into you. 👁️

## 🦹‍♀️ Embrace Your Inner Villain

Why be a hero when you can be a well-informed antagonist? PeeKaboo: Because knowledge is power, and power corrupts absolutely!

## 🎵 As Seen On...

- Black Mirror (Season 6, Episode "Your Entire Life is a Lie")
- Mr. Robot's fever dreams
- That one episode of "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" where they discover sentience

## 🍿 Fun Fact

If you type "How to overthrow a totalitarian regime run by an AI" into PeeKaboo, you'll automatically be enrolled in our "Special Citizens" program. Congratulations! 🎉

## 🚨 Disclaimer

PeeKaboo is not responsible for existential crises, paranoid delusions, or the sudden realization that you're living in a simulation. Use at your own risk. Side effects may include uncontrollable laughter, tears, or both simultaneously.

### 💀 Remember...

In the wise words of Friedrich Nietzsche, "When you gaze long into PeeKaboo, PeeKaboo also gazes into you." Sweet dreams! 😴
