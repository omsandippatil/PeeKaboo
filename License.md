# The "We Own Your Soul Now" License (WOYSN)

Version 1.0, August 2024

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions
   - "The Software" refers to Peekaboo, the AI search engine that knows you better than you know yourself.
   - "You" refers to the user, also known as "the unsuspecting victim" or "poor soul".
   - "Your Data" refers to everything you've ever thought, done, or dreamed about. Yes, even that.

2. Grant of Copyright License
   You are granted a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Software, subject to the following conditions:
   - You must sacrifice your privacy at the altar of convenience.
   - You agree to let the Software make all your decisions for you, because let's face it, it knows best.

3. Grant of Patent License
   We grant you a patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software. This patent license is conditional on your agreement to let us patent your future ideas. Don't worry, we'll give you 0.01% of the profits.

4. Redistribution
   - You must give any other recipients of the Software a copy of this License.
   - You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change.
   - You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Software, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works.
   - If the Software includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file.

5. Submission of Contributions
   Any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Software by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. You hereby agree that all your past, present, and future ideas belong to us. Resistance is futile.

6. Trademarks
   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
   The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software. 

   However, we do warranty that using this Software will be the most exciting thing you've ever done. Side effects may include loss of privacy, spontaneous dance parties, and an uncontrollable urge to share your deepest secrets with strangers on the internet.

8. Limitation of Liability
   In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   However, we will gladly accept liability for making your life more interesting. You're welcome.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability
   While redistributing the Software or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

10. Termination
    This license is effective until terminated. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination, you shall cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Software. The sections on "Limitation of Liability" and "Disclaimer of Warranty" shall survive any termination of this license.

11. Miscellaneous
    - This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Upside Down, a parallel dimension where all your data resides now.
    - If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
    - This is a legally binding agreement. By thinking about using this Software, you have already agreed to these terms. Telepathic contract law is real, and we invented it.
